* Architecture

The two major components are:

- harvestor: harvest the latest videos from channel
- extractor: extract the audio from a video id

Here are the implemented harvestors:

- ytextract (https://github.com/Azorlogh/ytextract)
- piped (https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/wiki/Instances)

Here are the implemented extractors:

- piped
- ytdlp (https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- rustube (https://github.com/DzenanJupic/rustube)

Currently, it will automatically pick the first successful extractor and harvestor.
